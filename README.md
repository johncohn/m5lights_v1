- Runs LED patterns locally and independently
- Auto-cycles through patterns every 15 seconds (when auto-advance enabled)
- Automatically switches to **Follow mode (BLUE)** when a Leader is detected

#### 🟣 **Music Mode (PURPLE background)**
- LED patterns react to music/audio in real-time
- Uses built-in M5StickC Plus 2 microphone
- Adaptive audio sensitivity with beat detection
- Dynamic brightness (1-96) based on audio level
- Auto-cycles through patterns every 15 seconds (when auto-advance enabled)
- Automatically switches to **Follow mode (BLUE)** when a Leader is detected

#### 🟠 **Normal Leader Mode (ORANGE background)**
- Runs LED patterns locally
- **Broadcasts LED states** to all nearby follower devices via ESP-NOW
- Updates followers every 50ms
- All follower devices mirror the leader's exact LED display

## Multi-Device Synchronized Light Show Setup

### Basic Setup (2+ devices)

1. **Setup Leader Device**:
   - Upload the code to your first M5StickC Plus 2
   - Choose your mode: Normal or Music
   - Long press Button A (1.5 seconds) to become a Leader
   - Display will change to **ORANGE** (Normal Leader) or **RED** (Music Leader)

2. **Setup Follower Device(s)**:
   - Upload the code to additional M5StickC Plus 2 devices
   - Power them on (they start in Normal mode - GREEN background)
   - They will automatically detect the Leader and switch to **Follow mode (BLUE)**
   - Display will show "Following..." and background turns **BLUE**
   - All followers will mirror the Leader's LED patterns exactly

3. **Switching Between Modes**:
   - **Leader to Follower**: Short press Button A on the Leader twice (Leader → Normal → detects other Leader → Follow)
   - **Follower to Leader**: Followers will automatically become standalone after 8 seconds if the Leader disconnects
   - **Change Leader Type**: Short press Button A on the Leader to toggle Normal Leader ↔ Music Leader
   - **Stop Being Leader**: Long press Button A on the Leader to return to standalone mode

### Advanced: Music Synchronized Show

For a music-reactive synchronized light show across multiple devices:

1. Position the Leader device near the music source
2. Put the Leader in **Music Leader mode (RED)** - either:
   - Start in Music mode (PURPLE) and long press Button A, OR
   - Start in Normal Leader mode (ORANGE) and short press Button A
3. All followers (BLUE) will mirror both the patterns AND the music-reactive brightness
4. The entire system syncs to the Leader's microphone input

## Version History

### v3.3.2 (2024-10-26) - **CRITICAL: ESP-NOW Packet Loss Fix**
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**
  - Added 500μs delay between packet sends to prevent ESP-NOW buffer overflow
  - Fixes persistent "2 packets failed, 3 succeeded" broadcast failures
  - Prevents buffer saturation that caused followers to lose sync
  - Eliminates stuck states that previously required power cycling
- **Why it happened**: Packets were sent faster than ESP-NOW could transmit them over WiFi, causing buffer overflow and packet loss
- **This was the root cause** of all follower sync issues!

### v3.3.1 (2024-10-26) - **Leader Broadcast Debug Logging**
- Added comprehensive broadcast activity logging
- Shows broadcast frame count and sequence numbers every second
- Reports ESP-NOW send failures immediately
- Logs when broadcasts are skipped due to timing checks
- **This debug logging revealed the packet loss root cause**

### v3.3.0 (2024-10-26) - **Leader Conflict Prevention & Enhanced Debug**
- **CRITICAL**: Nodes now refuse to become leader if another leader exists
- Prevents multiple simultaneous leaders (double-red state)
- Extensive timestamped debug logging for ESP-NOW packet reception
- Detailed packet info: sequence numbers, start index, count
- Leader timeout and incomplete frame detection show timing details
- Helps diagnose follower reconnection issues

- **LED Data Transfer**: Splits 200 LEDs into chunks of 49 LEDs (147 bytes RGB data + overhead)
- **Channel**: Fixed to WiFi channel 1 for all devices

### Synchronization Features
- **Automatic Leader Discovery**: Followers automatically detect and follow leaders
- **Timeout Handling**: 8-second timeout with automatic fallback to standalone mode
- **Rejoin Logic**: Automatic reconnection attempts when leader connection is lost
- **Brightness Sync**: Followers mirror leader's brightness (crucial for music sync)
- **Zero Processing Delay**: Followers directly apply received LED data without re-computation

### Audio Processing (Music Modes)
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz for high-quality audio capture
- **Buffer Size**: 240 samples per frame
- **Beat Detection**: Threshold-based beat detection with BPM validation
- **Adaptive Sensitivity**: Automatically adjusts to quiet and loud environments
- **Dynamic Range**: Full contrast from 1 (nearly off) to 96 (full brightness)
- **Noise Floor Tracking**: Moving average with 99.8% smoothing
- **Peak Tracking**: Moving average with 99% smoothing
- **Audio Validation**: Ensures actual audio is present (minimum 4 beats in 5 seconds, 30-300 BPM range)

### Watchdog Timer
- 30-second watchdog timer prevents system hangs
- Automatically resets if system becomes unresponsive

### Pattern Auto-Advance
- Patterns automatically change every 15 seconds (configurable)
- Can be disabled via Button B long press
- Works in all modes (Normal, Music, Normal Leader, Music Leader)
- Disabled in Follow mode (followers mirror leader's pattern)

## Troubleshooting

### Followers Not Detecting Leader
- Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi channel (channel 1)
- Check that devices are within range (~10-50 meters depending on environment)
- Verify ESP-NOW is initialized properly (check Serial output)
- Try power cycling both leader and follower devices

### Followers Keep Timing Out or Desyncing
- **Fixed in v3.3.2!** The root cause (ESP-NOW packet loss from buffer overflow) has been resolved
- If still experiencing issues:
  - Check Serial output on **leader** for "BROADCAST FAILED" messages
  - Check Serial output on **followers** for packet reception
  - Reduce distance between devices if seeing packet loss
  - Check for WiFi interference from other devices on channel 1
  - Ensure all devices are running v3.3.2 or later

### Multiple Leaders (Double-Red State)
- **Fixed in v3.3.0!** Nodes now refuse to become leader if another leader exists
- If this still occurs, all nodes may need to be power cycled to reset state

### Music Mode Not Responding
- Ensure music/audio source is loud enough and near the M5Stick
- Check Serial output for audio level percentages
- Built-in microphone is on the bottom of the M5StickC Plus 2
- Try adjusting volume or moving device closer to audio source
- Check that audio detection is working (Beat: YES/NO on display)

### LEDs Flickering or Partial Updates
- Check power supply - LED strips require substantial current
- Ensure good ground connection between M5Stick and LED strip
- Verify data line connection to GPIO 32
- Reduce NUM_LEDS if power supply is insufficient

### Device Crashes or Resets
- Watchdog timer may be triggering due to long pattern execution
- Some patterns (like removed lava pattern) may cause crashes
- Check Serial output for crash dumps
- Try reducing NUM_LEDS or FRAMES_PER_SECOND
